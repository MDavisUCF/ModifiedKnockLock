How can you set your own knock unlock code?

Adjust these for your own knock pattern
- change `minLowMs`, `maxLowMs`, `refractoryMs`
- change the number of knocks needed to unlock

What are those things?
- <b> minLowMs <b/>
    What it is: The minimum time (in milliseconds) the tilt switch must stay LOW to count as a knock.
    Why it matters: Filters out tiny electrical noise or super-quick bounces.

    Typical tweak:
      Lower it (e.g., 10 ms) → more sensitive, may count micro-taps.
      Raise it (e.g., 30 ms) → less sensitive, ignores very light knocks.
