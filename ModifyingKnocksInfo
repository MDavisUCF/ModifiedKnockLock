How can you set your own knock unlock code?

Adjust these for your own knock pattern
- change `minLowMs`, `maxLowMs`, `refractoryMs`
- change the number of knocks needed to unlock

What are those things?
- minLowMs
    What it is: The minimum time (in milliseconds) the tilt switch must stay LOW to count as a knock.
    Why it matters: Filters out tiny electrical noise or super-quick bounces.

    Typical tweak:
      Lower it (e.g., 10 ms) → more sensitive, may count micro-taps.
      Raise it (e.g., 30 ms) → less sensitive, ignores very light knocks.

- maxLowMs
    What it is: The longest time the switch can stay LOW and still be a valid knock.
    Why it matters: Stops someone from just holding the sensor closed and getting “infinite knocks.”

    Typical tweak:
        Lower it (e.g., 600 ms) → must be a quick tap/tilt.
        Raise it (e.g., 1500 ms) → allows a slower, longer tilt.

- refractoryMs
    What it is: The “cool-down” after a valid knock. During this window, new triggers are ignored.
    Why it matters: Prevents one real knock from counting multiple times if the sensor bounces.

    Typical tweak:
        Lower it (e.g., 150 ms) → faster back-to-back knocks allowed.
        Raise it (e.g., 400 ms) → requires more spacing between knocks.
