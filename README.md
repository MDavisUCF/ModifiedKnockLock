# ModifiedKnockLock
This is a modified version of the Arduino Project Book's project 12 Knock Lock to replace the piezo with a tilt sensor.

You will be using:
- (2) 10k ohm Resistors
- (3) 220 ohm Resistors
- (1) 100uF Capacitor
- (1) Button
- (1) Tilt Switch
- (1) Servo
- (3) LEDs (Red, Green & Yellow)

You will connect this project following the project book, but without the piezo. 

The tilt switch is using the the connection as outlined in Project 11 Crystal Ball. 

Below is a graphic I made showing all the connections.
